# docker-monitoring
This is a front-end of my second version of Docker Monitoring.

The front-end is developed using BootStrap and Chart.js. Now it is just a static website, all the data are random data
for a better demonstartion of the view. 

The next step I am going to use Golang to write the back-end, and also add more functions to my application.

So far, it is just a redo of front-end of my previous docker monitoring tool.
